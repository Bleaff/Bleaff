# 👋 Hi, I'm Sergey

A software engineer focused on computer vision systems, modular streaming architectures, and embedded development. I build clean, extensible, and high-performance pipelines — from low-level RTSP/FFmpeg to high-level node orchestration.

---

## ⚙️ What I Do

- 🧠 Design DAG-based CV pipelines using YAML config and process/thread separation
- 🎥 Work with RTSP, FFmpeg, PyAV, GStreamer — from camera input to RTSP output
- 🧩 Build modular systems using custom `BaseNode`, `BaseReader`, `BaseInference`, and `ZMQMailbox` logic
- 🛠️ Develop low-level camera interfaces in C++ using FFmpeg and libav* (including on boards like Luckfox and Orange Pi)
- 🔌 Create reusable embedded modules (e.g., plug-and-play Arduino settings server)
- 🐍 Mix Python and C++ where it makes sense — clean high-level code + performant core
